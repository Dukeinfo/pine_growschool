                        <h2 class="secTitle">Admission Process</h2>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">Admission</h3>
                        <p>It is advised to plan a visit to the school campus after seeking an appointment with the School Admission Office and familiarize yourself in regard to all the rules, facets, aspects and quality of the school.</p>
                        <p>The admission procedure starts with Registration of the child for admission.</p>
                        <p>Please note that Registration does not guarantee admission.</p>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">Registration</h3>
                        <p>Registration is normally open throughout the year. Both NRI and resident Indian children are to be registered. Registration entails filling in the requisite “Admission Form”, submitting the applicable documents and remitting the requisite registration fee,  through registered post or by hand in the School Office. (Registration Fee and all other applicable School Fee is mentioned in the “Fee Schedule”  Section).</p>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">Important Note</h3>
                        <p>It is imperative to understand that reasonably good academic competence is necessary, for a child to be able to perform well in a boarding school environment, where the co-curricular and activity curriculum doesn't allow extra-time for academic pursuit and lots of time is consumed in building personality, value systems, confidence, independence, self-reliance and self-dependence, which are of paramount importance. </p>
                        <p>Hence, you need to plan to send a child to a hostel only if you think your child will be able to come to these expected levels independently. Keeping this in view, the procedure has been framed to gauge the general intelligence and academic standard of the child. There is no particular syllabus required for the boarding school orientation. It would consist of the previous class syllabi based on the National NCERT parameters and guidelines.</p>
                        <p>Students applying for Classes II - VI are required to visit the Dharampur Campus, on a date scheduled by the School's Admission Office, for a Boarding Orientation Programme and for students applying for Classes VII, VIII, IX and XI shall be attend the “Boarding School Orientation Programme” held at the Subathu campus, on a stipulated date, in early February. This date is mentioned in the school calendar.</p>
                        <p>All new admissions must join the school after successful completion of their academic session in the previous school and obtaining proper Transfer Certificate/ School Leaving Certificates, as per formats authorized by the CBSE /ICSE/State Board.</p>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">NRI Admissions</h3>
                        <p>All parents who are NRIs or earning in foreign exchange and those whose children are not Indian nationals shall be considered as NRI children.</p>
                        <p>Please note that NRI students (seeking admission in Classes VI and VII) are granted direct admission, subject to availability of seats, and are excused from attending the “Orientation Programme” in person. This is permitted if the child is flying in from abroad for the sole purpose of seeking admission. NRI children seeking admission in Classes VIII and above will need to attend the “Boarding School Orientation Programme”.</p>
                        <p>The standard rule being that the admission will be granted provisionally for the first year and further continuance will depend on the child's performance, academic and otherwise, during the first year of his/her stay in the school.</p>
                        <p>As an NRI, it is advisable to get the child admitted only if you have some relative/friend who can be the local guardian, for visiting your child on visiting weekends, short/long holidays and shoulder responsibility, especially in case of emergencies.</p>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">Vacancies</h3>
                        <p>Vacancies are generally available for both boys and girls. For Classes VI and VII at Dharampur or Subathu location of Pinegrove School, depending upon the availability of seats and in Classes VIII, IX and XI admission is available only at Pinegrove School, Subathu.</p>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">Admission</h3>
                        <p>The list of successful candidates is declared after the Orientation, in the month of February and the admission needs to be accepted/ declined within a week from this declaration.</p>
                        <p>Admissions are granted with due preference to NRIs, brothers/sisters of present Grovians, brothers/sisters/children of Old Grovians, children of serving defence personnel, war widows, Govt Employees and brilliant scholarship/free-ship students from the poorer section of society.</p>
    
                        <h3 class="widgetTitle text-dark fs-5 mb-3">Age Criteria</h3>
                        <p>Admission, as per the NEP 2020, need to be offered in Class I (1st Grade) for a child aged between 6 to 7  (six to seven years) as on 31st March and for Class VI and child should be aged between  12-13 years as on 31st March of the year of admission. The age criteria for the subsequent classes may be calculated. Generally, the accepted formula is, age of child minus 6 = Class to be admitted.</p>
