                                <p>A famous adage advocates as follows: "The future of a country is made or unmade in its classrooms"... One cannot undermine the importance of classroom teaching vis-a-vis other activities but they definitely have a very important role to play. Our primary objective is to impart high-quality academic tutoring so that the pupils may perform well in academics and the secondary and tertiary aims are to involve the children in various games and other co-curricular activities.</p>
                                <p>In a residential school, activities find an equal, if not more important, place in curriculum development. All requisite infrastructures are available in Pinegrove School, to provide the children with the facilities needed for quality education.</p>

                        <p>All the students, both boys and girls, are divided into four Houses, <span style="background-color: yellow;padding: 0 4px;">Chinar</span> (Yellow) , <span style="background-color: green;color: white;padding: 0 4px">Deodar</span> (Green), <span style="background-color: red;padding: 0 4px; color: white;">Oak</span> (Red) and <span style="background-color: violet;padding: 0 4px; color: white;">Teak</span> (Violet). Each house is looked after by a House Master/Mistress who in turn is assisted by the student prefects. All the teachers are also allocated a House.</p>
                        <p>The prefect system is an essential part of a residential school for delegating responsibility to children so that they learn to exercise initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Houses have been named keeping in view the need for making the children love nature and become environmentally conscious.</p>
